          Usage Notes: This flavor and its specializations are most commonly used

          where the constraints of the type are tighter than can be conveyed. For

          in UCUM, a need to convey a REAL when the type has been constrained to INT,
          etc.

          With coded datatypes, this null flavor may only be used if the vocabulary
          binding has a coding strength of CNE. By definition, all local codes and

          No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless:

          Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of ''unknown''.
          (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys ''unknown'') Those
          properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown. (E.g. specifying
