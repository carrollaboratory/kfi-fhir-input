description: "Brain tumors are the most common form of cancer in children aged
  0-19 in the United States, and are the largest cause of cancer-related deaths. 
  The estimated number of new cases in 2019 is nearly 3,800 and thus brain 
  tumors are a rare disease. Despite their relative rarity, the years of 
  potential life lost due to brain tumors in 2009 was estimated at 47,631 years 
  for children and adolescents aged 0-19 in the United States; this is a 
  disproportionate amount of life lost compared to adult cancers and 
  represents an unrecognized societal threat. There is an urgent need to improve 
  therapies for these children. Most of the high-grade glial and embryonal brain 
  cancers still remain largely incurable despite decades of clinical and 
  laboratory research. Existing non-targeted chemotherapies and radiation, while 
  at times effective, often represent pyrrhic victories, leaving behind life-long 
  health burdens and causing a significant risk of secondary malignancies. NIH 
  funded pediatric brain tumor cohort-based genomic dataset generation efforts 
  have lagged behind other histologies and have yet to be included as part of 
  large-scale sequencing efforts. However, consortia-based initiatives like those 
  supported by the Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) have demonstrated the 
  early potential for clinically annotated genomic cohorts and their utility and 
  interest by both the pediatric cancer and structural birth defect community 
  with more than 130 data access requests for a non-embargoed cohort of 
  tumor/normal whole genomes and paired tumor RNAseq. Indeed more than one 
  quarter of this 800-subject initial sequencing cohort were identified to have 
  birth-defect-associated clinical annotations in their clinical records, however, 
  to our knowledge limited to no trio-based genomics cohort studies exist for any 
  one pediatric brain tumor histology. The project's proposed sequencing cohort 
  defines the largest, clinically annotated pediatric brain tumor cohort study to 
  date and seeks to define the intersection of germline and somatic underpinnings 
  of pediatric brain tumors across a shared developmental context of cancer and 
  structural birth defects."
